In starlink/build.sh you have to edit  MY_CVS_ROOT=$CVSROOT if you have not
got $CVSROOT. It is better to hard wire it anyway.

In starlink/buildsupport.sh you have to edit  MY_CVS_ROOT=$CVSROOT if you have
not got $CVSROOT. It is better to hardwire it anyway.

In starlink/buildworld.sh you have to edit  MY_CVS_ROOT=$CVSROOT if you have
not got $CVSROOT. It is better to hardwire it anyway. You should also edit
JAVA=YOUR_JAVA_PATH and set it you the path of your java command. If you
need to check in componentset.xml and Makefile.dependencies then you will
have to uncomment the code for that where it says to do so.

When you do perl Makefile.PL to build the Makefile you should set
PREFIX to a location where you want the builds to be done, i.e where
there is enough space to hold three starlink builds/installs. Under
PREFIX the builds are done in PREFIX/build.
